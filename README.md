# Dead By Daylight Companion
The Dead By Daylight Companion (DBDC) is a program i created to assist with DBD's sub-par features regarding accessibility/ease of access.  
The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive way to use commonly requested features that usually require alot of effort / multiple other programs.  
DBDC is in early access and still has a long road of updates, features and support to go.  
**DBDC is entirely free to use**, although any support is greatly appreciated!  
# Config Editor

The config editor features the most extensive range of options that allow you to customize the look and graphical fidelity of your game to your liking!  
The config editor is always being updated and plans to feature things i **didn't even know were possible** until looking into them recently ;) stay tuned for that!

# Hook Counter

The hook counter uses image recognition to detect when a survivor has been hooked, when a detection is made a pip icon will be rendered next to the corresponding survivors portrait just like when you're playing survivor!  
This part of DBDC is still in prototype alpha so it is not polished and WILL contain bugs.  

# Crosshair Overlay

A basic crosshair overlay allowing you to use and customize a crosshair in game!  
The crosshair overlay is always open to suggestions for features and other ideas.

# F.A.Q.

## Is This Program Bannable?
**NO.** Nothing will ever be added to DBDC that risks triggering a ban, and you can see proof for all the features below:  
  
[Config Editor](https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/discussion/28949/can-anyone-confirm-this-is-legal). People have been editing their config files for years and not a single person has reported a ban.  
  
Hook Counter: The hook counter doesn't interact with Dead By Daylight in any way whatsoever, and has never been recognized as something the developers DONT want you to do,   
In lamens terms: you can remember which survivors have been hooked using your mind, so this is not an advantage.  
Should the developers make an effort to counteract something this feature will be removed.

The developers have officially confirmed their endorsement for crosshair overlays as something you can freely use!
## What's The Catch?
**No catch :)** developing this program allows me to display and improve on my ability to write clean, easy to read code, plus i get to help anyone who might find anything this program has to offer useful!  
## Can I Support You?
